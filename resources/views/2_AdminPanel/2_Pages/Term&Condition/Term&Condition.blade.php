                            <p class="text-muted">These Legal Terms and any policies or operating rules posted by us on the
                                Services or in respect to the Services constitute the entire agreement and understanding
                                between you and us. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Legal
                                Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These Legal Terms operate to
                                the fullest extent permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our rights and
                                obligations to others at any time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss,
                                damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any
                                provision or part of a provision of these Legal Terms is determined to be unlawful, void, or
                                unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Legal
                                Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. There
                                is no joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship created between you and
                                us as a result of these Legal Terms or use of the Services. You agree that these Legal Terms
                                will not be construed against us by virtue of having drafted them. You hereby waive any and
                                all defences you may have based on the electronic form of these Legal Terms and the lack of
                                signing by the parties hereto to execute these Legal Terms.
